# Whatsapp Unofficial Rest API in NodeJS

This is an unofficial Rest API for Whatsapp built with NodeJS. It allows developers to interact with Whatsapp using RESTful HTTP requests, making it easy to integrate Whatsapp messaging into their applications.

**NOTE:** I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.

## Features

+ Send and receive Whatsapp messages from NodeJS
+ Create and manage Whatsapp groups
+ Send and receive media files (images, audio, video) via Whatsapp
+ Get information about the current status of a user's Whatsapp account
+ Implement end-to-end encryption for secure messaging

## Installation

To use this API, you will need to have NodeJS installed on your system. Clone the repository and run npm install to install the required dependencies. Then, run npm start to start the server and begin using the API.

## Usage

This API is designed to be simple and easy to use. Once the server is running, you can send HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints to send or receive messages, create or manage groups, or perform other actions.
